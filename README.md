# Revealing the Unreal: Forensic Analysis of AI-Generated Sexually Explicit Content from Diffusion Models
This repository contains results from the paper “Revealing the Unreal: Forensic Analysis of AI-Generated Sexually Explicit Content from Diffusion Models” by Lukas Jaeckel, Quentin Stickler and Dirk Labudde.

**The generated images used for the experiments are available on request**.

## Assessment of Image Quality
For each model, the directory *image_quality* contains a CSV file that assigns a BRISQUE value to each image.

## Spectral Analysis

## Analysis of Textural Properties

## Analysis of Body Proportions
The directory *body_proportions* contains a subdirectory for each model. Each subdirectory contains a CSV file that assigns the calculated distances between the body keypoints to the corresponding image. The keypoints are each stored in a separate CSV file for each image in the directory *keypoints*.
